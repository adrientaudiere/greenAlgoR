Description: Computes the carbon footprint and ecological impact of computational tasks in R. 
  Based on the Green Algorithms framework (Lannelongue et al. 2021, <https://calculator.green-algorithms.org/>), 
  this package provides functions to estimate energy consumption and CO2 emissions from R computations. 
  It includes specialized support for targets pipelines and provides visualization tools for 
  carbon footprint analysis. The package helps researchers and data scientists to measure the environmental impact of their computational work.
